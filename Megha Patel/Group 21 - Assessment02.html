								<h3>Hello World! My name is Megha.</h3>
								<p> My Student Number is S3858020. While pursuing my desired degree, I am managing a full-time CSR supervisor job. When I'm not working or studying, you'll most likely find me reading or exploring lookouts with friends.   
								    <br> Technology has the facility to impact lives at a calibre and scale that has never been realized in the history of mankind. The conception that something I engender can impact someone across the world now, or in the future is what drives my passion for Technology. IT has always been a great source of regalement for me since I was introduced to coding in primary and secondary grade. My passion for web development and software made me select information technology as a unit in year 9 and 10. I was able to gain rudimental skills and understand the mechanism.  </br>
								    <br> Most of my IT experience is from self-education and working in different field and utilizing various software. Despite my lack of experience, I am passionate about programming and development. I especially enjoy the puzzle-like frameworks that go into designing a program. I really love networking, as well as all the technical information that fall under the larger umbrella of networking. I dote experimenting with different languages of computer, so I customarily spend my leisure time inscribing my own code or edifying myself an incipient coding language from rudimentary level.  </br>
								</p>
								<p> To explore my learning style, imagination, personality, and personal values, I took three separate types of tests. My personality was classified as a logician in a 16-personality survey. I'm a visual learner, which was demonstrated by my learning style. My score on the test of imagination was 70.26. Both of these assessments measured my skills and stressed my characteristics. It helps me to see my current self and how I can change to become a better version of myself. </p>
								<p>The rational personality is relatively unusual, accounting for just 3% of the population. I am proud of my ingenuity and imagination, as well as my unique insight and strong intellect. Learn from the past, live in the moment, and hope for the future. Albert Einstein once said, "The important thing is not to avoid questioning." When it comes to a project or a job, I like to look for some connections and see if I can create an innovative product or concept. New challenges pique my interest. </p>
								<p> I prefer reading or seeing pictures when it comes to learning styles. The same was mentioned in my learning style, indicating that I am a visual learner. In the creativity test, I received a score of 70.26, which is above average. This test describes various metrics across eight different sectors. The results indicate that I have the ability to abstract concepts from ideas and create associations between things that don't seem to be related at first. </p>
								<br> Curiosity about anything can contribute to change and progress in the world and a project. Bold people often push the envelope beyond what is required of them and knowing that I dare to do so makes me a valued member of the team. All of these characteristics, I believe, reflect my ability to collaborate effectively with others while also highlighting my personality and skills. </br>
								<p>No two people are alike; each has its personality and characteristics. Working in a group helps you to pool your thoughts and look at things from multiple angles. Based on the test results, I believe I will only have a few questions to fully comprehend and visualize the issue. When working together, people will disagree, but my skills will be useful during this difficult period. To keep the team together, I'll have to use my abilities to show both the positive and negative sides of the problem or solution. My ability to abstract concepts would aid the team in generating ideas. We can accomplish a lot as a team, and my curiosity will help us do so. Overall, my attitude and creative abilities benefit the team. </p>

								<h3>Hello World! My name is Mahammad.</h3>
								<p> My Student Number is S3909591. I love creativity and pursue many different hobbies to tame my hunger to express myself, ranging from music to drawing. Guitar, Ukelele, and piano would be my current go-to instruments. Originally from Bangladesh, I moved to Australia in 2013 at the age of 11. I learned most of my English through movies and TV-shows I watched as a child and was happy to come to Australia.
                                    My passion for IT stems from its creative aspect, which is also helped by the fact I love learning and discovering new things. 
                                    <br>Our current society is shaped by IT and is rooted in almost every industry; my eventual goal is to start a company or companies which changes our way of living using emerging technologies in IT. As an 8-year-old on an expedition through the vast collection of software on our family computer, I discovered Adobe Dreamweaver. I created quite a few websites using gifs I found on the internet and pictures of art and other things which I made.  </br>
								    <br> I studied software development and computing in VCE and learned to create new software using visual basic. We learned the basics of python, a language that I love very much and find a delight to use. I have some IT experience in terms of “professional” work, such as helping my mum set up her shop on Amazon, Etsy, eBay, and her Shopify website. Other than that, I have no professional experience in IT.  </br>
								</p>
								<p> The results of the Myers Briggs Type Indicator show commanders are natural-born leaders. People with this personality type embody the gifts of charisma and confidence, and project authority in a way that draws crowds together behind a common goal. However, Commanders are also characterized by an often-ruthless level of rationality, using their drive, determination and sharp minds to achieve whatever end they’ve set for themselves. Perhaps it is best that they make up only three percent of the population, lest they overwhelm the more timid and sensitive personality types that make up much of the rest of the world – but we have Commanders to thank for many of the businesses and institutions we take for granted every day. My strength would be being efficient, energetic, self-confident, strong-Willed and strategic Thinkers. Meanwhile my weakness is that I am stubborn and dominant, intolerant, impatient and arrogant.  </p>
								<p> I believe these tests support my existing believes about my skills in working in a group. I work better as a leader than being led. I am happy to work in a group, but I feel the bigger picture, which allows me to be a better leader than being occupied by small details that eat away my motivation and patience. When creating a group, I would need to keep in mind that the members are creatively complementary. They would also need to be willing to be led to solve any problem our group face.</p>

								<h3>Hello World! My name is Suruchi.</h3>
								<p> My student Number is S3910962. I am currently opting to fulfill the master’s degree in teaching. IT has been playing an influencing role for the students as well as teachers that assist in better understanding. I have been interested in taking up the ICT course which would help me in future growth. I graduated with Bachelor of professional Accounting on 2018. I speak English, Nepali, Hindi. My hobbies are Reading books and exploring new places. 
								<br> It is evident from my information shared in the above section that I do not have any background in IT. This course is taken up by me as I want to pursue a master’s degree in teaching and currently, ICT is transforming the learning environments.  In this regard, my interest in the course is mainly developed from the point that having knowledge on this would enhance the education quality. </br>
								<br> The teachers also need to be further updated with the needed technical skills and thereby enhance the teaching skills. I don't have any experience or background in IT, so it is all about the role of ICT in improving education that compelled me to take up the course. I have taken up admission in RMIT as the university offers the course and prepares for success. During my studies, I will be exploring and learning new concepts, ideas as well as equipping myself with the required knowledge.</br>
								</p>
								<p> The first test talks about the kind of personality exhibited by me which is virtuosos that seeks for exploring everything with cool rationalism as well as spirited curiosity. The personality test also speaks that the decision made by such people stems from a point of practical realism.
								</p>
								<p> The second test illustrates the learning style which is Auditory (Schilling et al. 2020). With this learning style, I try to learn things by reading out loud and have an easier time in terms of understanding instructions. 
								</p>
								<p> The third style illustrates that I am more inclined towards agreeableness, Neuroticism as well as openness. The tests and assessments have been enlightening and have created an accurate image of my personality in my own mind. This has helped me in analysing the areas that I am lacking and significant improvements in the field of confidence, ways of directing the mental energy as well as the ways in which I would react to the situations.
terms of team formation some of the key qualities such as agreeableness, tactics in the decision making, approach towards work, and openness shall be of great help (Kyllonen and Kell, 2018).

										<h3>Hello World! My name is Shruti.</h3>
								<p>
								<br>My student Number is S3909048. I come from Nepal. My hobbies are traveling, cooking delicious Nepalese cuisines, watching movies, and reading romantic novels. 
I have studied Accounting my whole life but my interest in IT grew up when I first came here in Australia when I realised that it plays a significant role in accounting or in any other sectors. IT has enabled companies to develop and use computerised designs to collect and store financial transactions rather than storing in hard books. 
                                 </br>
								 <br> There is not a particular event or person that sparked my interest in IT, but I wanted to develop knowledge and skills in technology so that it would benefit me personally and professionally. As I do not have any background in IT whatsoever, I saw it as an opportunity to learn and grow new skills when I came around this course. </br>
								<br> I am currently studying Master of Teaching in Alphacrusis College. Even though I wanted to study IT, I did not want to get separate degree on IT. Hence, I decided to go with Open Universities where I can study a single subject online at my own pace. </br>
								</p>
								<p> These tests were so fun to do yet the results actually who I really am. Every question in all the three tests were precisely put together to really show my inner personality.
The results show that I am introvert, visual learner and creativity is one of my strength. These results indicate that my behaviour is shy in a team. I look for ways to share my creative ideas with other team members. I try to learn by pictures and visuals rather than hear things. 
When forming a team, I would like to be in a team where my team members have different personalities than me so that they can compensate my drawbacks. I think it will be valuable for the team if I can learn something others behaviour and learning styles.

										<h3>Hello World! My name is Pratibha.</h3>
								<p> My student Number is S3909823. I am a creative and innovative person. I am a quick learner and can give the actual shape to my imaginations. I have interests in sketching and reading. I have master’s in Professional Accounting and Running master’s in teaching (Secondary) and Diploma of Information Technology. I speak English, Nepali and Hindi.  
								<br> I find programming part interesting in IT. When I was doing programming language in my Bachelor’s in Business Administration as a part of curriculum, my desire to learn more about programming language grew. I joined web designing course and learnt Html, CSS, Dreamweaver and Java script there. Being in management field, I never found the programming language uninteresting. For, IT is the growing field and have wide scope in careers, I can’t be separated from aspects of IT despite of any profession I choose. </br>
								<br> Having completed my master’s degree, I have decided to satisfy my interest in IT by doing Diploma of Information Technology at RMIT. My knowledge about IT will always help me to excel in my career. I expect to develop an IT base of my knowledge to help prosper in my career no matter which profession I choose as IT is an integral part in all fields.  </br>
								</P>
								<p> The result of these three tests reflects me that I am more of an extrovert person and sensitive to other people’s feelings and have a mix learning approach. In my opinion, I can fit in the job which requires teamwork and communication. Having the ability to lead and go well in a team contributes towards team effectiveness. My organised and decisive nature will help the team to reduce stress and maintain harmony among the team members. 
								Attention to detail and through learning and team communication will help the team to achieve accuracy. I should always consider my personality traits so as not to affect the team but to motivate the teamwork and team proficiency. I should respect others’ feelings and views and encourage communication before and after making decisions.

										<h3>Hello World! My name is Malak.</h3>
								<p> My student Number is S3893774. I am a Pakistani Australian by nationality and Yousufzai Afghan or Pathan by ethnicity. I have done bachelors in business administration. I am qualified and worked in a number of areas in Australia as well as overseas i.e. real estate, hospitality, OH&S, manufacturing, transport and warehousing. Beside my education and employment experiences I have owned and managed my personal businesses named SMG Pty ltd and Instant Computing solutions Pty ltd. My hobbies and interests include gardening, travelling, exploring different cultures and cuisines, enjoying nature and photography. PlayStation gaming. Cricket and badminton are my favourite sports.
								
								<br>My interest in IT has a very unique background which is related to my dear father. My father was a banker was amongst the very first few customers in who bought a computer system in early 1990’s. Our first computer system had 386 MHz CPU with around 4 MBs of RAM and flexible floppy disk as ROM. I was updating my skills and knowledge with latest trends and updates in new operating systems, applications and IT systems. It was from this childhood passion that an appealing IT interest for career related future was born which I followed through informal learning and practices in past by setting up and managing my own IT business named as Instant computing solutions.  </br>
								<br> I achieved moderate experience in different areas of IT from software, hardware and to setting up small networks etc. I would like to explore and broaden my knowledge of IT in these specific areas databases, networking, Internet security, cloud services, software and hardware. I would like to further enhance and refine my IT skills in this flourishing and demanding industry.</br>
								</p>
								<p> According to Myers-Briggs Personality test my personality type is Defender. It totally relates to the person I am. It means I can be a very good team member as these types of personalities are very reliable and dedicated. They are at their best in a harmonious, well organized, calm and slow-paced work environment, and feel motivated if tasks are clearly defined.
								</p>
								<p>According to Leaning Style test I am a visual learner. They notice small details. They are good planners, decision makers. They have a good memory and sense of direction. They have good research and problem-solving skills. I totally agree with this test result as I find it hard to concentrate for long when something is said without visual aids. I retain knowledge gained through visuals longer.
								<br> According to the results of Big Five Personality test I scored the highest on factor III I.e., agreeability which depicts that I am a friendly and optimistic person. For a good team member, it is extremely important to be friendly and easy going plus optimism can always help keep the moral of the group high. Which shows I can be a good addition to any team or group I work with. </br>
								<br> Factor IV and V are also high enough which means I will be one of the responsible and careful members of the team. Which can help reduce the risk of mistakes and failure and will help keep things on track and organized which is very essential for any team to achieve their goals and objectives effectively and efficiently. I tend to be open to new experiences which can help in the creative part of tasks assigned to any team.  </br>
								<br> On the other hand, I scored lesser on Factor I and II. Which means I need to be more emotionally stable to deal with any conflict arising in the group so that my performance won’t be affected. I also tend to be an introvert who again can be a drawback for working in a group as this trait reduce one's chances of instant bonding with other team members.
I agree with most of the test results.

								<h3>Here's a general statement regarding the similarities between the groups ideal job selection.</h3>
								<p>From the information gathered on our ideal job selections, it is clear that Trent and Martin will have similar lines of work where they will both be working on building or creating software and applications. The differences in the two would be that Trent’s work will involve some more leadership and management skills as he has stated that he would like to start a company involving his mobile application. This is not to say Martin could not do the same, but at this point Trent’s would involve more about customer service and business skills. Tim and Michael would also be doing similar work in a sense, where they will both be providing a company with the testing of software or programs and troubleshooting them. They will both need to be able to understand hardware and have the ability to upgrade it when necessary. The slight differences would be that although both jobs would require quite a high amount of security, I feel that Michael’s work is a bit more hands-on with the hardware side of it, whereas Tim’s is more along the lines of organising and overseeing the security and software as a whole. Like most IT jobs, I feel that we would all have the potential to be a part of a team or bigger company, but we would also have the ability to be a freelancer if that is what we desired. I believe based on our individual skills we will be learning. We would work great as a team overall as we would have knowledge about how to program software and create apps, we would have sufficient business and administration skills and we would have the troubleshooting and secuirty skills needed to make sure everything is running smoothly.

										<h3>What is your ideal job?</h3>
										<p>Tech leads are in charge of managing the technical aspects of the software development process in a specific context. A good tech lead is a software engineer who enables the team to work with quality and ensures the success of distributed solutions.
										</p>
										<h3>How does this contrast to Pratibha?</h3>
										<p>Prioritizing user requirements, overseeing system upgrades, and researching new tools are all responsibilities of an IT Analyst.

Excellent communication and problem-solving abilities are required, which are also aspects of my roles and responsibilities. The ideal job will necessitate collaboration with an IT analyst to discuss the project and the risks to the business and clients.
										</p>
										
										
										<h3>How does this contrast to Shruchi?</h3>
										<p>Suruchi Shrestha's ideal job would be to become an IT teacher who is up to date on the latest IT trends and enjoys sharing their knowledge with their students. Students learn the fundamentals of technology and how to apply basic information technology tools in their daily work and lives. They teach in elementary, middle, and high schools. My ideal job and her ideal job do intersect at some point. She must be informative, as must I, and we must both teach (for me to staff) and learn new things on a daily basis.
										</p>
										
										<h3>How does this contrast to Malak and Shruti?</h3>
										<p>A technical manager is an expert who leads a team of technical staff in a software or technology company. I must guide the software development or software development team and check out specific topics such as software development, design tasks and product versions. IT managers, who are ideal for Malak and Shruti, determine the company's IT needs and are responsible for implementing computer systems that meet the requirements of the business information system.
										</p>
										<p>I will be expected to have proficient experience with software development and a significant knowledge of technology, as well as to be adequately prepared to lead a group and collaborate with others. I will be in charge of assisting their colleagues with the technical aspects of their jobs, such as coding and programming.

										</p>
										
										<h3>How does this contrast to Mahammad?</h3>
										<p>Rawnak as a chief technology officer (CTO) will be in charge of managing an organization's technical aspects to ensure that they are in line with the company's growth goals. They will also manage technical resources and ensure that they are geared towards technological advancement. On the other hand, I will in charge of team leadership and technical direction alignment. Establishing a technical vision, resolving technical disagreements, and managing the technical quality of team deliverables are all part of providing strong technical direction. Rawnak's and my responsibilities are nearly identical and overlap.

								    <p>IT is a vast discipline and has wide range of career aspects. I choose to become an IT SOX Compliance analyst whilst my other team members choose to become IT manager, Chief technology officer, technical lead and an IT teacher. 
									</p>
										<h3>What is your ideal job?</h3>
										<p>My dream job IT SOX Compliance Analyst is a blend of both finance and IT. It is an IT role but within the rules and regulation of Sarbanes- Oxley Act which protects the rights of shareholders, stakeholders and general public. This role does not only require the knowledge and experience in IT, but also requires the experience, in accounting, auditing, and SOX compliance framework. I chose a blend of these subjects because of having background.
										</p>
										<h3>How does this contrast to Megha?</h3>
										<p>Technical lead is directly related to IT as the role require to lead and organise the IT team. Being a technical lead, Megha will require to lead the technical experts in a company which looks after software development, design and product launches. Comparing with my ideal job, Megha will require more leadership skills and technical skills than me. We both will have to provide technical support. We both may require to do codings and communication skills is vital in both job titles. While technical lead is purely an IT work, my job is the blend of finance and IT.
										</p>
										<h3>How does this contrast to Suruchi?</h3>
										<p> IT teacher is also a blended career of IT and education. This role requires an up-to date knowledge about IT trends and developments along with the syllabus requirements. Comparing with my role, Suruchi’s role is different. I will need to work with IT and Finance department, but Suruchi will need to deal with students and her colleagues. She may need to have good programming skills to teach other students. She needs strong leadership qualities than me to influence her students’ learning. I will have to work in a team, whereas, Suruchi can work independently.
										</p>
										<h3>How does this contrast to Malak and Shruti?</h3>
										<p>: Similar to my job, IT manager is also the mix of IT and management. This role requires a combined skill set of IT, planning, staffing, organising, leading and controlling the organisational resources. As managers, Shruti and Malak will have to look after the company’s electronic networks and resources of IT department. They may have to deal with several vendors and customer companies to contract their IT services. Being a manager needs high skills sets and experience. I personally, think that an IT manager is a challenging role. Comparing to their role, my responsibility as an IT SOX compliance analyst will be limited to IT and Finance. They require more experience and skill sets than my job requires.
										</p>
										<h3>How does this contrast to Mahammad?</h3>
										<p>As a Chief Technology officer, Rawnak will be the in charge of technology or engineering branch. It is the high rank and Rawnak will need to harness through a series of job levels before reaching to that position. While he will need to exercise higher level of rights and responsibilities, I may not require that. But we both need to have idea about management and should possess good communication skills.

								<h2 class="major">Suruchi</h2>
										<h3>What is your ideal job?</h3>
										<p>Unlike the other members of my group, I am taking this course because I want to obtain a Master's degree in education, and ICT is actually changing learning environments. In this respect, my curiosity in the course stems mostly from the fact that knowing more about it would improve the standard of education. IT teachers who are effective keep up with the new IT patterns and enjoy sharing their experience with their students. Students learn about technology concepts and how to use simple information technology techniques in their jobs and lives from IT teachers. They instruct students in primary, middle, and high school
										</p>
										
										<h3>How does this contrast to Megha?</h3>
										<p>Her ideal job is a technical lead at a software or technology company. They lead a business development or software engineering team and examine specialised topics such as software development, design tasks, and product launches on a routine basis. Whereas, only basic knowledge should be covered by an IT teacher such as, Computers, laptops, printers, routers, projectors, and electric whiteboards, Photoshop, Illustrator, and grade book applications and networks to ensure that all of the computers in the computer lab are connected and functional.
										</p>
										<h3>How does this contrast to Pratibha?</h3>
										<p>She dreams of working as a SOX Analyst. Sarbanes Oxley Analysts introduce and coordinate procedures in order to ensure that Sarbanes-Oxley standards are met. Gathers, analyses, and publishes data on financial statements internal management systems. Whereas, IT teachers have to pay attention to trends in their industry. This involves continuing education and professional development courses, as well as self-learning.
										</p>
										
										<h3>How does this contrast to Malak and Shruti?</h3>
										<p> Looking at the ideal careers of my group members, I discovered that Malak Khan and Shruti Shrestha both want to be an IT manager. IT administrators are in charge of an organization's electronic networks and IT departments. To take on a senior position, you'll usually need several years of experience in the industry, and an IT management master's degree will help. Whereas, comparing my dream job with them, a bachelor's degree in education with a specialisation in information technology is required for an IT teacher.
										</p>
										<h3>How does this contrast to Mahammad?</h3>
										<p>He wants to be a chief technical officer. The Chief Technology Officer (CTO) is the company's highest-ranking technology executive and is in charge of the technology or engineering branch. They create processes and protocols and use automation to improve external-facing goods and services. Whereas, IT teacher instruct students in primary, middle, and high school about technology concepts and how to use simple information technology techniques.

										<h3>How does this contrast to Megha?</h3>
										<p>Her ideal job is digital tech lead. She will be responsible for the technical architecture and software development. Her ideal job and my ideal job are similar in terms that we need to manage our teams and deliver our projects. We both need to be expert in programming language and managing skills.   
										</p>
										
										<h3>How does this contrast to Suruchi?</h3>
										<p>Her ideal job is IT teacher. She is pursuing Master of Teaching and hopefully wants to teach IT in schools. Her ideal job is completely different than mine. She can become IT teacher as soon as she finishes her master’s degree with minimum experience. However, I will have to work for 8 years to be eligible for my ideal job. Her ideal job is not in the list of Burning Glass. 
										</p>
										<h3>How does this contrast to Malak?</h3>
										<p>His ideal job is to become an IT Manager in a reputed firm. His ideal job is same as mine. His job has responsibilities like maintaining technological needs of the company and managing IT teams which are similar as responsibilities of my ideal job.   
										</p>
										<h3>How does this contrast to Mahammad?</h3>
										<p>His ideal job is Chief Technology Officer (CTO). This position is expected to manage staffs like an IT manager. Our ideal jobs are similar in that sense. However, CTO is the external face of the organization and works with partners to better the technology the organization sells. But IT manager looks after the works inside the organization.

										<h3>What is your ideal job?</h3>
										<p>IT Manager
										</p>
										<h3>How does this contrast to Megha?</h3>
										<p>Ideal job of Megha Patel is a technical lead who is an expert that manages a group of technical staff at a software or technology organization. They regularly lead software development or software engineering team and investigate specialized issues that include software development, designing assignments and product releases. While an IT manager which is an ideal job of mine (Malak Khan) determine the IT requirements of the business and are responsible for implementing computer systems to meet the business information system's needs.
										<br>A technical lead requires to have a proficient experience with software development and a significant knowledge of technology, yet they will be adequately equipped to feasibly lead a group and work along with others. A technical lead is responsible for assisting their colleagues with the technical parts of their positions, like coding and programming. They may describe new projects to their group and investigate any issues that occur.
										</p>
										
										<h3>How does this contrast to Pratibha?</h3>
										<p>Whilst Prabitha K C ideal job is IT SOX Compliance analyst who is mainly responsible for evaluating information technology (IT), platforms, and operating procedures in accordance with established standards for efficiency, precision, security and risk mitigation; as well as, explain regulations as they apply to information systems, platforms, and IT operating processes, practices and procedures; and, determines and proposes enhancements to current risk management controls. (IT Compliance Analyst job in San Diego at General Atomics | Lensa n.d.)
The job of compliance analyst is limited to policies and procedures while IT manager is responsible for the overall management with the help of IT.
										</p>
										<h3>How does this contrast to Suruchi?</h3>
										<p>Suruchi Shrestha’s ideal job is to become an IT teacher who needs to stay aware of the most recent IT trends and love to share their knowledge with their students. Students are taught the basics of technology and how to use basic information technology tools in their day-to-day work and lives. They instruct at the elementary, middle, and high-school level. There is hardly any comparison possible between my ideal job I.e., IT manager and her ideal job of becoming an IT teacher because management and teaching are completely different fields. The only thing that is common between the two is the knowledge of IT.
										</p>
										<h3>How does this contrast to Shruti?</h3>
										<p>Whilst ideal job of mine (Malak Khan) and Shruti Shrestha is being IT managers. The position of IT manager emerged from the IT department to be "the face" for an organization' internal teams and the units it serves. It is the IT manager’s job to keep consistent business measures running effectively so the organization is productive and runs smoothly.
										<br>IT managers needs information on IT systems and processes however it's not important for them to be a system specialist themselves. Their job is to understand what technology and IT can help the effective running of an organization. Incase if certain process requires enhancing or if automation can streamline the back office, then the IT managers should be informed in first place.
										</p>
										<h3>How does this contrast to Mahammad?</h3>
										<p>In contrast ideal job of Muhammad Rawnak is Chief technology officer who looks outwards and regularly comes from a background of an inventive technologist. The CTO's external focus directs them in line of client needs and how the business can deal with accomplice organizations who provide solutions based around the business core technology. In other terms, IT managers oversees IT infrastructure and the CTO deals with the business technology architecture. The individual improves the organization's capacities by making sure the technology it provides can fulfill the business needs.
										<h2>IT MANAGER</h2>
										<li>Organisation wide face of the IT department</li>
										<li>Internally emphasised on enhancing business processes</li>
										<li>Creator of the organization's IT infrastructure that achieve its organisational objectives</li>

							<h3>Heres a general statement about <br>
								our groups required skillsets
							</h3>
							<p>When referring to Burning Glass Technologies (2018), this group presents with a wide array of skills, resulting in a well rounded and broadly skilled group. When contrasting the individuals ideal jobs in this group, software engineers and IT support Co-ordinators are ranked within the high to average demand according to Burning Glass Technologies (2018), with demand increasing in recent years for jobs as a project engineer (seek.com.au, 2020). This shows that the skills acquired within this group are going to be useful in the future.
							</p>
							<p>When looking on an individual level, all group members require strong communication, time management and teamwork skills. These skills have proven themselves within the bounds of this assessment task. The group has demonstrated clear communication and undertaken their individual parts to get the group task completed.
							</p>
							<p>Given the broad skills set, this group should be able to perform cohesively as a together as each individual brings their own speciality skills, filling an important role within the team. The key skills a software engineer would be learning would be programming, designing and coding whereas the key skills for a project engineer and IT support co-ordinator would be focused on organising, security skills and upgrading or fixing hardware. In contrast this should mean that as a team we would function well together and compliment each others work. With Trent also wanting to create his own app and possibly company that would bring strong leadership and management skills to the team. Maritn and Michael might not need business management or business analysis as much as other skills but they would prove useful for Tim and Trent. On the other hand Tim would not necessarily need SQL, JavaScript, Java skills but they are required for a software engineer which is a good example of our broad skillset where we should always have a team member who has some knowledge about any task we may face as a group.

										<h3>Job Title:</h3>
										<p>Project Engineer
										</p>
										<h3>Demand (Based on Burning Glass Data):</h3>
										<p>Job is not ranked in the Burning Glass data. Seek.com.au suggests the demand for Project Engineers will rise by 13% over the next 4 years (Seek.com.au, 2020).
										</p>
										<h3>IT-Specific skill set (Based on Burning Glass Data):</h3>
										<p>Due to the burning glass data, Project Engineer is not classed as an IT-Specific job and therefore does not indicate any IT-specific skill sets. Seek.com.au states Project Managers skill sets to include: Management, Communication Skills, Infrastructure, Design, a Engineering qualification and autonomy skills to be highly regarded (Seek.com.au, 2020).
										</p>
										<h3>General Skills (Based on Burning Glass Data):</h3>
										<p>Project management is rank 6th based on skills required for the top flagship jobs. This is also a skill that is recommended to study once completing an engineering degree to improve your skills as a project engineer. Occupational health and safety, ranked 20th on the same list, is another skill that I would be required to complete for my desired job.
										</p>
										<h3>Three highest ranked IT-specific skills which are not in my reauired skill set:</h3>
										<p>Out of all the the IT-specific skills listed in the Burning Glass report there are no skills that could really be placed in a not required basket. To some extent all of it could be required depending on the current project being worked on.
										</p>
										<h3>Three highest ranked general skills which are not in my reauired skill set</h3>
										<p>Basic Customer Service, General Sales, and General Sales Practices are the three highest rated skills that would not be a requirement for my ideal job. These skills would be more useful for a product that was in the production stage as opposed to a more R&D branch.
										</p>
										<h3>Has my opinion of my ideal job changed after viewing the Burning Glass Data?</h3>
										<p>Overall I found the information on Burning Glass to be narrow and yet scattered. There was not enough information in the report to remotely change my opinion. Additional the fact that a lot of the information is based on resource points such as mentions in online posts it would be interesting to see if they had anything in place to stop the information from being scewed.

										<h3>Job Title:</h3>
										<p>IT Support Coordinator
										</p>
										<h3>Demand (Based on Burning Glass Data):</h3>
										<p>IT Support co-ordinators appear to be at an average level in demand, ranking 18th out of 25 Information Technology job sectors. This ranking data was supplied by Burning Glass Technologies in March of 2018 (Burning Glass Technologies, 2018). There are over 1000 jobs on seek right now for IT support co-ordinators, which indicates there must be an average demand for jobs. (seek.com).
										</p>
										<h3>IT-Specific skill set (Based on Burning Glass Data):</h3>
										<p>As a IT support co-ordinator the IT related skills I would need to complete my job at the best potential would be experience with office 365, Onedrive, VM and servers, Cisco, general IT fault finding, hardware upgrading and security over IT and emails having oversight of reports and incidents.
										</p>
										<h3>General Skills (Based on Burning Glass Data):</h3>
										<p>The general skills I would need as an IT support co-ordinator would involve a lot of administration skills specifically with office 365, Onedrive and servers. It would also involve management skills in overlooking everything and making sure it is all running properly the fixing anything that needs it. A big part of the job would be to have communication skills so you can let your team know what is going well and what is not doing so well. There would be organisation skills in allocating where to use software and programs and fault finding anything in the system as a whole.
										</p>
										<h3>Three highest ranked IT-specific skills which are not in my reauired skill set:</h3>
										<p>Based on the data recorded on burning glass, as an IT support co-ordinator the three highest ranked IT-related skills which are not neccesarily required include graphic design, customer service and software engineering. As an IT support co-ordinator I would not need graphics design skills, I would not neccesarily need customer service skills as I would mostly be working for and interacting with the business and their systems and I would not need software engineering skills as I am not actually creating the software but just monitoring it and upgrading hardware.
										</p>
										<h3>Three highest ranked general skills which are not in my reauired skill set</h3>
										<p>Based on the data recorded on burning glass, as an IT support co-ordinator the three highest ranked general skills which are not neccesarily required include writing, creativity and leadership. Writing might make it easier to communicate but is not really required, creativity is not needed as it is more of a research and factual job and you need a small amount of leadership skills but I believe it would be more team work and management than actual leadership.
										</p>
										<h3>Has my opinion of my ideal job changed after viewing the Burning Glass Data?</h3>
										<p>My opinion of my ideal job has not changed after seeing what is required for the job. It has just highlighted the skills it will require and what other things that I had not thought of, that I must do to achieve success in this job. I remain excited to learn and persue the skills that I will need.

										<h3>Job Title:</h3>
										<p>Software Engineer
										</p>
										<h3>Demand (Based on Burning Glass Data):</h3>
										<p>Software Engineers appear to be in constant demand, ranking 11th out of 25 Information Technology job sectors. This ranking data was supplied by Burning Glass Technologies in March of 2018 (Burning Glass Technologies, 2018). Australia’s leading job market company Seek.com.au indicates Software Engineers job growth is set to grow 23.4% projected over the next 5 years (Seek.com.au, 2020).
										</p>
										<h3>IT-Specific skill set (Based on Burning Glass Data):</h3>
										<p>Software Engineers are required to cover a broad range of technical and non-technical skills. Technical skills listed on Burning Glass Data would suggest SQL, JavaScript, Java, SAP, Technical Support, Microsofts C#, LINUX, .Net Programming, Git, Python and Systems Engineering (Burning Glass Technologies, 2018). According to Seek some additional technical skills Software Engineers should consider are: Testing, Software Development and Amazon Web Services (Seek.com.au, 2020). This broard range of technical skills would be highly regarded by career prospects.
										</p>
										<h3>General Skills (Based on Burning Glass Data):</h3>
										<p>A Software Engineer would be be considered a professional engineer (Career Explorer, by Sokanu, 2020). This would mean Software Engineers would require a broad range of general professional skills. Burning Glass Technologies General Skills data has indicated the top skills in demand and Software Engineers would require the following; Communication skills, problem solving, organisational skills, writing, team work, planning, troubleshooting, detail-orientated, creativity, research, time management, presentation skills, meeting deadlines, analytical skills, team building, management, multi-tasking, English, self-starter and decision making (Burning Glass Technologies, 2018). These are a broard range of skills and the majority are highly desirable to employers.
										</p>
										<h3>Three highest ranked IT-specific skills which are not in my reauired skill set:</h3>
										<p>The three highest ranked IT-specific skills covered in the Burning Glass Technologies ’Skills in Greatest Demand’ which are not in a Software Engineers scope include Project Management, Business Management and Building Relationships (Burning Glass Technologies, 2018). These skills would be highly regarded as Business related more so than what would be expected from a Software Engineer.
										</p>
										<h3>Three highest ranked general skills which are not in my reauired skill set</h3>
										<p>The three highest ranked General Skills covered in the Burning Glass Technologies ’Skills in Greatest Demand’ which would not be regarded as ’required’ by a Software Engineer include: Leadership, Mentoring and Quality Assurance and Control. Although Software Engineers would be required to have some experience in these skills, they would not be required to become a Junior Software Engineer, as these skills are required by Senior level Software Engineers (Seek.com.au, 2020).
										</p>
										<h3>Has my opinion of my ideal job changed after viewing the Burning Glass Data?</h3>
										<p>The Burning Glass data has revealed some consolidating evidence that, this is a pathway I wish to continue on. To be a great founder of my own mobile application I would consider the skills required to be akin to those of a Software Engineer. Therefore, my opinion on my ideal job has not changed, rather, has expanded my understanding on what is required to get to my ideal job.

										<h3>Job Title:</h3>
										<p>Software Engineer
										</p>
										<h3>Demand (Based on Burning Glass Data):</h3>
										<p>The demand for software engineers seems to be steady; somewhat above average according to the data (ranked 11 out of 25). I believe that there are reasonable prospects for employment.
										</p>
										<h3>IT-Specific skill set (Based on Burning Glass Data):</h3>
										<p>If I am to assume that a software engineer requires the following; SQL, JavaScript, JAVA, Microsoft windows, project management, SAP, Graphic design, Microsoft C#, software engineering, .NEt programming, website production, Python, and systems engineering then I would surmise that the demand of the IT-specific skills of a software engineer are rather desirable according to the data.

						<!-- Personal Profile -->
							<article id="interview">
								<h2 class="major">Interview with IT<br> professional</h2>
								
								<p>Trent W. was able to secure an e-mail interview with the Executive Director (CEO & Founder) of one of Australias leading software developers – Appello. Cameron Woodford has successfully grown his company into what it is today, over the last three and a half years. With more than fifty IT professional employers located in over four countries – theres no doubt Cameron has achieved IT professionalism. Cameron was chosen as the IT professional to interview, as Trent is currently working with Appello to develop his mobile application idea. The interview was set to take place on a FaceTime call with a third camera recording in accordance with the interview.pdf supplied by RMIT. However Cameron relayed that he is extremely busy and asked if he could answer any questions we had via e-mail and he’ll reply when he can. The questions include those written by the Assessment Criteria and by group members. Screenshots of all e-mails can be found below the following questions:</P>

								<span class="image main"><img src="images/Interview0.png" alt="" /></span>

								<p>Cameron was thanked for his time and agreed for me to share his LinkedIn account and company website information which can be found below:

								</p>
								<p><a href="https://www.appello.com.au/"> Cameron Woodford's Company</a>.
								</p>

								<h3>Please Tell us about your IT work. What exactly do you do?</h3>
								<p>I am the founder of an app development agency – Appello. I look after about 6-7 groups of programmers (front and back end), UI/UX designers, graphic designers, marketers and project managers, which all live-in different time-zones. I oversee the entire development of new and existing clients progress and work with those clients to seek investors – which I have built quite a network over the years. I also engage with early clients such as yourself to guide them through the early stages of an app idea and assist by building working prototypes like While You’re Out in which you can start seeking investment to begin development. There is a lot to manage, and my phone is always going off, but I have a great team behind me and that makes it a whole lot easier.
								</p>

							<span class="image main"><img src="images/Interview1.png" alt="" /></span>

								<h3>Please tell us about the industry you work in.</h3>
								<p>I work within the software development industry. It was difficult to start acquiring jobs in the beginning but as my team expanded, so too did the client-base. There are heaps of app development agencies or competitors around now however, we found if you add the human element of caring, making software as if it were our own dream, that is what wins our clients over. We are working in a $70+B industry (Fact checked – App Store = $46.6B, Google Play Store = $24.8B in 2018 (Iqbal, Updated June 23rd, 2020)) and so we need to continuously expand our knowledge and keep up to date with the latest technologies to stay ahead.</p>

								<span class="image main"><img src="images/Interview2.png" alt="" /></span>

								<h3>What other kinds of work do you have to do?</h3>
								<p>When our clients are ready to progress their prototypes into the development stage, I work with those clients and introduce them to right investors and have even pitched the idea with some of them. I come in as the technical lead and explain what we are doing for our client and I believe that helps investors with their risk assessments as we are becoming a recognised and trusted agency in Australia.
								</P>
								<p>I have to fly around a lot, and COVID-19 put a halt to that very suddenly. Although I live and work in Sydney, I fly around primarily the East Coast of Australia to engage with my employees there, and to have meetings like when we met to discuss your original idea.
								</p>
								<p>When mobile applications are ready to be sent off to the app stores, I work with marketers, project managers and the clients themselves to ensure the success of the launch. This is the most rewarding experience as seeing our work and our clients dream downloaded by them from their preferred app store, can be pretty emotional. We like to let clients have that moment, but we assure them it’s only the beginning and that work needs to continue. We apply post launch strategies like app store optimisation and growth hacking through third party channels to boost awareness of the client’s app and engage more users.
								</p>

								<span class="image main"><img src="images/Interview3.png" alt="" /></span>

								<h3>Who are all the different people you interact within your work?</h3>
								<p>The people I work with are all professionals in their field. As I mentioned earlier, the teams I manage ultimately focus on three stages for app development: Design, Development and Launch. Within each group I work alongside different professionals.
								</P>
								<p>In the design stage of a client’s work, I manage a team of front-end developers, product designers, UI/UX developers, the teams lead and managers. I would say this is the most challenging work that we do. These professionals are the ones that pick our clients brains until they’ve designed something the client loves – this is hard.
								</p>
								<p>In the development stage we include the back-end developers to begin working with the front-end developers to build out the software. The other professionals mentioned before are also included in the development stage however not so much as they are required for the design stage. The front-end developers build out the interface while the back-end developers write the server-side code. This can be a long process.
								</p>
								<p>In the Launch stage we bring in the quality assurance team to analyse how the app is performing post launch. They work closely with the UI/UX designers, product and graphic designers and both front and back-end developers to work on maintenance or updates.
								</p>
								<p>The client is brought in at every step during this process to ensure they’re happy with the direction of their idea. Our whole team and I work for the client, and it is important to remember that in our industry, the client is not always right, and often-times doesn’t even know what they want, and it is our job to provide solutions to the problems they’re trying to solve.
								</p>

								<span class="image main"><img src="images/Interview4.png" alt="" /></span>

								<h3>Please tell us about your interactions with other IT professionals</h3>
								<p>Apart from my professional employees, I don’t engage with a lot of other IT professionals regularly as I am busy with my work. Needless to say, they are all very talented IT professionals.
								</p>

								<span class="image main"><img src="images/Interview5.png" alt="" /></span>

								<h3>What about your interactions with clients or investors?</h3>
								<p>My interactions with clients go similarly to how we met, although not always. You originally spoke to Roman who brought to my attention your idea. It was lucky enough I was in Brisbane to come out and meet you to further discuss your idea. We brainstormed the potentials and I assured you that your idea is viable. We then proceed to the design stage in which you’re prototyping your idea. We send each other Adobe XD files which doesn’t normally happen ahaha, but it is extremely helpful to visualise your idea. After the prototyping stage we intend to introduce you to investors which will be necessary to start development of your app. Like I’ve previously said, I will be choosing investor groups I think you will most benefit from, I do this for each client. I will also consider investing in your idea as I am really interested, as we spoke about a few weeks ago. Anyway, after a successful capital raising, we can begin the development stage which you will receive weekly updates via e-mail and video conferencing – I try to make all of these. Similarly, to the development stage, post launch interactions with clients often-times reduces to monthly updates or as the client needs us.
								</P>
								<p>My interactions with investors on a personal level only go as far as the client needs me. I have an extensive network of investors amongst different specialised fields which I can contact and set up meetings and product pitches for. I relay information about the work we do to the client which is asked for by the investors or investor groups. Upon success or deny of capital raising, we assess the feedback and move forward from there. After success, we are bound to execute and delivery and so I am constantly in contact with the investors or firms via e-mail and phone calls to update them of details such as deliverables, contracts and accounts.

								<h3>What aspects of your work do you spend most time on?</h3>
								<p>Although I like to include myself on all aspects of my work, I spend most of my time on the Launch stage of app creation. I spend most of my time here as I find that, as a business, it is the most important part to keeping my business alive. We have a reputation to uphold which is to build great quality applications and to generate revenue. I like to be somewhat in control at this stage when communicating between clients, investors and my team to ensure all stakeholders come out satisfied in the end, and I think I’ve experienced enough for my input to be considered somewhat worthy.
								</p>

								<span class="image main"><img src="images/Interview7.png" alt="" /></span>

								<h3>Which aspect of work do you find most challenging?</h3>
								<p>I think finding the right team and tools, was the most challenging part of this whole venture. Some of my professional employees are freelancers and live all throughout the world. It was horrible trying to organise and collaborate on tasks, but we introduced Monday.com in 2018 which is a project management software platform. Since then we have been collaborating much more effectively and all my employees are up to date with everything they need to know – this is moderated by our project managers. It was necessary for my team to streamline communication and collaboration to stay alive.
								</p>

								<span class="image main"><img src="images/Interview8.png" alt="" /></span>

								<h3>Can you share an example of the work you do that best captures the essense of the IT industry?</h3>
								<p>The best part of what I do within the IT industry is building our clients idea they’ve held onto for so long into a physical (or digital) product. We have the potential to create software that could impact so many lives around the world. It is a great feeling knowing you’ve been a crucial part to someone’s success and those human feelings are the best feelings in the IT world. I can’t wait for While You’re Out to be ready for launch, I must say I’ve got a lot of confidence in your idea – you’ve done well.
								</p>

								<span class="image main"><img src="images/Interview9.png" alt="" /></span>

								<h3>Are you personally happy with your job?</h3>
								<p>I absolutelty love what I do, it keeps me on my toes but it is extremely rewarding. I have the freedom of where I want to work, how I work and what I focus on while at work. I get to work with exciting ideas from clients and constantly expand my knowledge with my employees. I am extremely happy I started Appello, like you, it was once an idea.
								</p>

								<span class="image main"><img src="images/Interview10.png" alt="" /></span>

								<h3>Do you have to work long hours?</h3>
								<p>Yes, and no. I do work long hours however I say this because I am to be available 24/7 most of the time. There are periods where pressing matters are priority and I am either in a meeting at 3am or working with my managers to fix a problem or provide support at 5am for example. This doesn’t deter me as I have been called a workaholic amongst my team ahaha.
								</p>

								<span class="image main"><img src="images/Interview11.png" alt="" /></span>

								<h3>Do you discover new things at work? If so how often?</h3>
								<p>Yes, almost daily. I work with people bursting with ideas, and this allows me to discover new things all the time. It could be a new app idea which I then makes me think about all the possibilities of that idea, or new technology amongst my employees such as Python or Figma updates. The technology world evolves every day and so there is always something new to find.

								<h3>Cyber Security</h3>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/cybers.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p><strong>What does it do?</strong></p>
								<p>The project was a factor of wide efforts in the support of enhancement of research and development agenda with an overarching approach. The transformation in the digital field has restructured the world and will uniformly continue the status of transformation in the economy. Technology is a key factor for understanding that advancement in technology will lead to societal and economic advantages. The benefits of technology also bring challenges of security that users have to deal with and overcome. The government of developing countries fosters to grow and expansion in the line of technology by dealing with the challenges and leading to success in the department. Thus, an overarching issue in the sector of cybersecurity is its difficulty and poor statement. </p>
								<p>The limitations of the sector of cybersecurity are uniformly and increasingly advancing and be difficult to evaluate the areas that have been researched and the other ones which are just overviewed and ineffectively evaluated. Hence, the sector of cybersecurity is advancing in terms of expansion and in terms of challenges. The sector seems to suffer from reliability in the field of scarcity and evaluated data and mainly from huge sectors with huge and complex data. The main areas of concern are the lack of research in the sector of cybersecurity within the context of national security provided. There are many concerns in terms of legal and ethical topics with a number of statements emerging in the field (Berman, Buczak, Chavis, and Corbett, 2019). </p>
								<p>Cyber-attacks are common these days and current studies mention that every 39 seconds a system is hacked in the US. Further, once an attack happens, then huge files and data can be harmed. Cybercrimes happen on the global level and with organizations of government. There is a need to adopt measures of cybersecurity due to the fast-emerging issues in the field of technology that will lead to a boom in cybercrimes happening on a daily basis. It is stated that in an era of networks, there is a requirement for re-defined cyber strategies. Further, mentioning that the rise in vulnerabilities in the cyber sector of software systems will lead to challenges and lead to the need for cyber measures to deal with the challenges. There has been an influx of attacks and data breaching activities happening at large companies and organizations (Ferrag, Maglaras, Moschoyiannis, and Janicke, 2020). It causes the loss of millions of dollars that have been invested to recover from the hack. Not only the whole organization but sometimes even individuals have to face cyber-attacks. This puts the privacy of an individual the family members connected at stake. </p>
								<p>In the coming years, there will be a huge effect of cybersecurity as with advancements in technology people are getting easy access to the data of others. The privacy of individuals has been a mess and increased the need for cybersecurity to deal with the issues. Researchers have suggested that to adapt advancements at the personal and organizational level it is necessary for them to adopt the measures of cybersecurity. The sale of cybersecurity is flexible, and researchers have evaluated that people will adopt the measures over the need of the hour. The future of cybersecurity will be largely evaluated as the hackers will continue to foster tools and techniques to get access to the private data of individuals and organizations. Small- and medium-sized companies will be more prone to cyber-attacks and many of these people lack cybersecurity knowledge will make them potential targets (Li, He, Xu, Ash, Anwarand Yuan, 2019). </p>
								<br>
								<p><strong>What is the most likely impact?</strong><br>
									The impact of cyberattacks can cause cybersecurity breaches. These are points at which the information contained within an object of interest is accessible to purveyors of said information. If cyberattackers can get ahold of their target information, then they can utilize this information for their own purposes. The results of this vary depending on the personality and motive of the attacker. The attacker may be motivated by personal reasons, such as a family situation. The attacker may be motivated by a financial situation, such as a need to pay bills. The attacker may be motivated by an environmental situation, such as taking advantage of an event (electrical shutdown) so as to profit.
								<p>Cyber-attacks can cause major risks and threats to personal as well as organizational objectives. Further, cybercrimes have been emerging at a higher rate due to advancements in technologies and tools, and techniques for hacking. Cyber-attacks have been common in recent times due to a lack of knowledge amongst people about cybersecurity. However, if people increase their cybersecurity knowledge then there can be a huge impact on this development. 
								<br>Cybersecurity is a crucial affair as the amounts of data that have been gathered and collected over the cities and services of the companies. Cybersecurity will ensure development as the data gathered by organizations or individuals will be kept safe. The rival companies will not be able to breach the personal data and will serve as the most beneficial asset of companies. The main impact of cybersecurity over firms will be optimum utilization of the measures and safety of networks from various hazardous nodes that try to gather wrong access to the network of companies. The impact of cybersecurity will be to companies to avoid the potential risks and eliminate the hacking of systems and information. Besides this, it is advantageous for the mental well-being of people and it encourages the sense of cyber-attacks in the mind of an individual. The huge and complex data of organizations can be easily handled and there will be a support of stakeholders in an effective way (Lallie, Shepherd, Nurse, Erola, Epiphaniou, Maple, and Bellekens, 2021). </p>
								<p>The companies with huge and complex data will be most impacted by cybersecurity as it will be easy for the team to keep their data private and safe from data breaching. The application of cybersecurity measures will replace the jobs of the data management team and will handle the complexities and issues in a better way than the team. </p>
								<br>
								<p><strong>How will this affect you?</strong></p>
								<p>In the day-to-day life of people, the measures of cybersecurity will enhance the capacity of data handling and will avoid the issues of data breaching. Having a system to ensure the safety of information gathered will improve the efficiency of working without having worries. Cybersecurity will enhance the quality of data management. Accessing the system without any anti-virus software will make it easy for a working process is equal to going out without putting locks on the door. Cybersecurity will ensure peace of mind and eliminate one to go through long procedures of keeping the data safe and secure. Cybercrime will be eliminated and allow one to gather huge data and keep them safe. Cybersecurity will allow one to grow and explore new technologies without the fear of system hacks. Without cybersecurity, people might end up with the fear of data breaching and could not enjoy the strategic advantages of new emerging technologies in the market (Srinivas, Das, and Kumar, 2019). Thus, it will increase the sense of virtual safety amongst people and help us to deal with challenges in an easy way./p>
								<p>Cybersecurity includes adapting the concept of virtual safety and building a prior approach towards the safety and security of work. Cybersecurity will provide one with many advantages including financial, social, and strategic advantages to deal in the present era and the future time. Cybersecurity will change the ways of working with complex data and information and ensure that working is done effectively without risks. Hence, cybersecurity is necessary to foster growth and development (Sun, Hahn, and Liu, 2018). </p>

								<h3>AUTONOMOUS TECHNOLOGY</h3>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/machine.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p><strong>What does it do?</strong></p>
								<p>According to Synopsys (2021), “Autonomous cars rely on sensors, actuators, complex algorithms, machine learning systems, and powerful processors to execute software”. The sensors like radar sensor, video camera, lidar sensor, and ultrasonic sensor are used in vehicles to create an understanding of the environment, so that the vehicle automatically monitor the position, read traffic lights, track other vehicles and pedestrians, identify road edges, lanes and vehicles nearby while running as well as while parking (Synopsys, 2021). These inputs are then processed by advanced software and the instructions are sent to the vehicles’ actuators to control speed, brakes, and direction of the vehicle (Synopsys, 2021). 
								<br>The algorithms coded rules and modeling and object recognition help to keep align with traffic rules and prevent obstacles. Six levels of driving autonomy have been recognised starting from level 0 (fully manual) to level 6 (fully autonomous) where the driver controls most of the functions in autonomous vehicles from level 0 to level 2 and autonomous system controls the driving in vehicles from level 3 to level 5 (Synopsys, 2021).</p>
								<br>
								<p><strong>What is the most likely impact?</strong></p>
								<p>The concept of the autonomous vehicle is exciting and going to accelerate within few years. It is the future evolution of the automotive industry which we cannot avoid (White, 2019). Autonomous technology exists and is undergoing testing (White, 2019). Some forms of autonomy have already been popular such as cruise control, autopilot (Tesla), traffic jam pilot (Audi), but vehicles with full levels of autonomy are still on testing and not available to the general public (Synopsys, 2021). Within the testings of past 60 years, we can see the progress in recent 5- 10 years such as cruise control, automatic parking, lane positioning, and so on (White, 2019). 
								<br>The main aim of this technology in the automotive industry is to enhance safety by reducing road accidents. But a substantial amount of study and testing are required before legalising autonomous technology. Some of the companies like Waymo owned by Google, Tesla, Audi, BMW, Mercedes, etc. have gone through a substantial amount of testing in the real as well as virtual environments (White, 2019). While Tesla’s autopilot system is already available in the market, BMW, Audi, Toyota, Kia, Ford, etc. are planning the production of fully autonomous cars by the end of 2021 (White, 2019). 
								<br>When everyone was excited about this blooming technology, the death of a 49- years old lady being hit by an autonomous uber has led question to of safety and the question that “can autonomous vehicles compete for the human instinct regarding dangers?’ (White, 2019). This incident led many manufacturers to elongate and intense their level of testing in recent years (White, 2019). Vehicle manufacturers, IT companies, and electronic companies are keen on this developing technology (Kato et al, 2015, p.60). The software, as well as hardware, should be improved continuously and testing with multiple numbers scenarios must be done before running the cars on the roads (White, 2019). 
								<br>These parties (Manufacturers, IT companies, Electronic companies) should work collaboratively to build an efficient autonomous vehicle from a scratch and then be tested for safety, reliability, and reasonableness (Kato et al, 2015, p.60). As the general public is very keen to get exposure to autonomous cars, intense testings are undergoing and levels of autonomous in recent vehicles are upgrading which gives the hint that fully autonomous cars are not so far from the reach of general people in upcoming years (White, 2019).
								</p>
								<p>The main impact of the autonomous car in society is the human dependence on machines which cannot be avoided in today’s world (Synopsys, 2021). It impacts positively on the convenience and quality of life (Synopsys, 2021). This technology will make driving safer and easier resulting in less traffics, accidents and deaths, parking ques, and so on (White, 2019). Importantly, this technology in vehicles can reduce environmental pollution by cutting off 80% of the CO2 emissions in the world (Synopsys, 2021). 
								<br>It can be accessible to the ones who can’t drive at the same time, it will leave the question that how will it impact the ones who enjoy driving (White, 2019). Another issue is its cost reasonableness. Autonomous technology is bitterly expensive so that it will be accessible to high-class consumers only (Synopsys, 2021). What will the keen middle- and low-income consumers do to access the technology? It will also have an impact on the job market of drivers who earn their lives by driving (White, 2019). The autonomous technology in vehicles will replace humans with machines leading to unemployment problems. 
								<br>Another negative issue is cybersecurity. Due to the extensive use of software, hackers can take chance to hack the software to take control of the vehicle and steal them (White, 2019). In addition, the existence of manual cars will be in question. This will affect several vendors, suppliers, hardware shops, manufacturers, and as a whole the job market of the people working in these sectors (White, 2019). At the same time, it will increase the job opportunities in IT sectors, electronic companies as well as research and testing centers (White, 2019).
								</p>
								<br>
								<p><strong>How will this affect you?</strong><br>
								<p>Overall, fully autonomous technology in vehicles is full of fascination and excitement. It will definitely make driving easier and more convenient. As a driver, being in an autonomous car will feel so safe. The sensors will help to be in the lane, follow the traffic, position the car and respond to any form of danger ultimately avoiding accidents. But for a driver like me who enjoys self-driving, it can be less attractive. For the students like us, the biggest impact of this technology is safe road traffics. 
								<br>Due to the reduced traffics, we can reach our universities and workplaces on time which will help us in time management. Reduced accidents will help prevent the untimely death and tragedy in the family and neighbor affecting the emotional well-being. Another good aspect is that it will open more job opportunities for us in the IT sector. At the same time, having a family member working as a driver and related jobs will be affected in terms of income cut off due to the replacement of manual drivers by the autopilot system. Another inevitable impact is the probability of social discrimination. 
								<br>Due to the expensiveness of this modern technology, it will be less affordable to middle- and low-class consumers. Despite the craze and fondness of autonomous technology, low-income consumers will still be deprived of it creating a social hierarchy.
<br>In conclusion, putting all the negative aspects aside, this modern innovation is amazingly a big evolution of the automotive industry. The benefits of this technology should be optimised as much as possible. Obviously, the world will be benefited by the aim of this technology reducing traffics, road accidents, and most importantly, carbon dioxide emission. But, before making it available to the general public, a substantial amount of research and testing are required.

								<h3>ROBOTS</h3>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/robots.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p><strong>What does it do?</strong></p>
								<p>In a general sense, a robot is just a machine that is designed to complete a task. Every machine is not a robot; only the machine that can sense, think and act at the same time can be called a robot. Firstly, the robot senses the environment around it through sensors like light sensors, cameras, temperature sensors, gas sensors, touch sensors and gathers information. Secondly, the robot processes the information about the environment with the help of microprocessors and microcontrollers. Finally, the robot uses motors and other actuators to carry out actions. For example, a drone must be controlled because it is just a machine. But if we give a drone the power to self-operate by utilizing its sense and intelligence then it can be called a robot.</p>
								<p>In the past, the robots focused on applications requiring next to no connection with people. Maybe then as friendly creatures with which to participate. Be that as it may, late business applications arise where the capacity to communicate with individuals in an engaging, connecting with, or consistent way is a significant piece of the robot's usefulness. Projects like Aurora are investigating robots' utilisation to assume a remedial part in assisting kids with illness (Breazeal, 2004).</p>
								<p>According to statistics from the International Federation of Robotics (IFR), global robot installations in 2019 dropped by 12% to 373,240 units worth USD 13.8 billion. However, Covid-19 is the digitalization booster. The electronics industry has flourished ever than before as a result of social distancing. There has been increased demand for the robotics industry as they are not affected by travel bans or quarantine.</p>
								<p>On March 1, 2012, the Nevada law went live, and ‘the Nevada Department of Motor Vehicles’ gave permission for a self-propelled vehicle in May 2012. Toyota Prius was the first car that was permitted with driverless innovation of Google company. And then Boston Dynamics made a robot with human features named Atlas for the ‘Darpa Robotics Challenge’ in 2013. Mechanical technology research groups in the college tried to make a machine to do the fundamental assignments in 2013 and even do the tests and exams in 2015. Atlas and Spot are the kinds of human robots with excellent artificial intelligence (Simon, 2020). </p>
								<p>Robotics is a study that studies the relationship between human beings and robots. A human being can for example meet an accident if they do not see a stop sign but a robot car will not make such a mistake. Today, the personal robot industry is worth about $5 billion but according to the Japanese Robot Association expects that this figure will reach $50 billion yearly by the end of 2025 (Gates, 2007). Robots are certainly helpful in all sectors, but they are going to populate the world. They need to be independent and do tasks without any human help.</p>
								<p>Sophia is the first human robot to get citizenship after she became a citizen of Saudi Arabia. It was developed by Hong-Kong and she resembles a human. Her appearance and behaviour resemble a human being. She makes appearances in different media and we can see her in interviews with high-profile people.</p>
								<br>
								<p><strong>What is the most likely impact?</strong><br></p>
								<p>As robots can do many tasks faster than human beings, people fear that they might be replaced by robots in work. Robots have dominated in medical surgeries, accounting, warehouses, factories, agriculture, and professional cleaning. But the people do not need to worry that their jobs will be replaced by robots because Government approaches are propelled by the difficulties of work expenses and work deficiency, just as the basic to lead another influx of Industrial Revolution. For businesses, the workforce challenges are significant contemplations for robot reception. As for workers, the high intentional turnover rates and the absence of solid and free associations may part of the way to add to their resilience of robot appropriation.</p>
								<p>The scientists found that for each robot added per 1,000 specialists in the U.S., compensation decrease by 0.42%, and the work to-populace proportion goes somewhere around 0.2 rate focuses- until now, this implies the deficiency of around 400,000 positions. The workers who have low income and perform manual labour are affected the most as industries have adopted robotics. Robots increase efficiency and productivity, hence the demand for labour has decreased.
Since 2004, each new mechanical robot introduced in the fabricating area dislodged a normal of 1.6 laborers from their positions. The full effect takes time to appear, in any case. </p>
								<p>Inside the primary year of a robot's establishment, generally 1.3 laborers by and large, from their work; this stretches out to 1.6 laborers over ensuing years (Oxford Economics). However, history shows the adverse consequence of innovation on business has been little enough to be inconsequential or imperceptible. For instance, the wrongly made dread that was stirred in the mid-1930s about whether candy machines will supplant retail workers but retail stores are still open in today’s date. Hence, some experts also believe that robots will never replace human labour rather they are made to ease the work of human beings (Yang, Henthorne, George, 2020).</p>
								
								<p><strong>How will this affect you?</strong><br>
								<p>Robots will have a great impact on human lives from different sectors. They can help farmers in the process of plantation and harvest. Robots can also help old individuals living in helped care offices or aged care facilities and can also provide emotional support as they might get lonely and depressed. Robots are also a great help in the police force as they can go in sites of danger before police and settle on more educated choices about how to continue. Robots can assist in hospitals and clinics to give prescribed medicines to the patients, and they can even perform risky surgeries that doctors are unable to do. In schools, robots can help students with special needs. Teachers will not be able to look after all the students, but robots can be functional in that task. Dyson Company has invented a vacuum cleaner that remembers the layout of any house and self-cleans all the corners of the house.</p>
								<p>Even though there is various type of robots available in the market, we have not used any kinds of robots in our lives. Being a student of Information Technology, it is fascinating to learn about different ideas and the development of robots in human life. Members of our family also have no access to any kind of robots in their daily lives. However, we all respect the works of engineers and scientists who are trying to make our lives easier.</p>

								<h3>Natural language processing & Chatterbots</h3>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/Natural.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p><strong>What does it do?</strong></p>
								<p>Natural language processing is a part of IT technology which deals with the interactions between computers and humans. Human language is categorized as “natural”, hence the term “Natural Language Processing(NLP)” is used to refer to software that deciphers the human language, and converts it into a desired computing language that can then be used by the machine or other pieces of software.
								</p>
								<p>Chatterbots or a chatbot, is a piece of software that is designed to communicate with a human. The chatbots see use as customer service agents. They communicate with a customer and provide responses to queries. Based on the construction of a chatbot, multiple humans may be served(or chatted with) at the same time, which increases the total amount of people/customers served per given rate. This is their use in some civil sectors, though they may also see use in entertainment sectors, news sectors, finance sectors and so on, with each being given a programming doctrine which matches their designated discipline.
								</p>
								<p>A chatbot is an example of natural language processing, as the chatbot is required to understand a given meaning(interpreting from a natural language, to a computer language) and produce a corresponding response(interpreting a response from a computer language, and converting it into a natural language).
								</p>
								<p>For the purposes that natural language processing is designed for, it is important that the software is able to correctly recognize various linguistic properties of whatever natural language input it receives. For this to be adequate, the software has to be able to recognize the sentimental(emotional sentiment) property of the input, speech recognition of the input(depends if the software is designed to take input via audio) and the syntax of the input(the subject of the sentence and what actions are taking place). In lieu of this, natural language processing finds use in many IT applications. Some examples include spell checking and keyword searching(useful for documents containing text). Other examples include information extraction(extracting information from any document or website) and advertisement matching(giving ads to users based on their browsing history).
								</p>
								<p>The development of natural language processing will result in software, that is better able to understand what it is that humans desire(for a given task). Which is followed by an appropriate response. For example, one of the capabilities provided by natural language processing is the ability to translate entire sentences and paragraphs from a foreign language, into a known language(exemplified further by “Google Translate”). Other instances of natural language processing include recommendations or advertisements. The software is able to select an item to show the user by interpreting said users browsing history information.
								</p>
								<p>The future of natural language processing revolves around developing the aspects mentioned above. That is, to improve natural language processing, one needs to improve the mechanisms and principles that it functions on. This involves improving the syntax deconstruction and word recognition system of the software, as well as the ability of the software to relate inputs to a relevant output.
								</p>
								<p>Chatterbot technology is a derivative technology of natural language processing, and hence grows in capability at a conjoined rate. It may see a more extensive use depending on how its development progresses. Some examples that chatterbots could develop into include nursing robots for babies, airplane assistant robots, navigation assistant robots, robotic shop employees etc. These examples are more indicative of chatterbot technology being a part of a larger aggregate, which includes many different types of technology such as robots and machine learning or AI.
								</p>
								<br>
								<p><strong>What is the most likely impact?</strong><br>
									Natural language processing by itself is a software that allows for machines to gain a rudimentary form of “understanding”, with regards to human language and thereby grasp the general intentions said human might have, regarding a particular query. The utility of natural language processing is felt more, when it is integrated into a larger aggregate such as a robot, or a large piece of software that has need of processing the human language. This is due to the fact that the idea of communication requires an input, an interpretation and a subsequent output which is related to the interpretation.
								</p>
								<p>The natural language processing technology, follows a more supplementary role which further enhances the capabilities of whatever it is that uses the technology. For example, if a robot is to interact with humans on a command-based relationship, which is more than simply picking up objects or moving to a particular destination, it will need a system or methodology or software which is able to process commands from a human. This is where natural language processing software comes into play. The software allows for machine-human relations with regard to the activity being projected or happening.
								</p>
								<p>Advances in natural language processing, will likely contribute to machines and software being more expressive/emotive regarding responses to queries in addition to a higher efficiency due to the faster recognition of the input, a faster interpretation and a faster response. This is exemplified by the existence of chatterbots, which are likely to become better at this particular aspect.
								</p>
								<p>Natural language processing is one of the IT technologies that will contribute to digital integration on a vast scale. The technology is endowed with the aspect of communicating human-machine relations, which invariably makes it a service of great importance, as humans must communicate in one way or another. This is the case regardless of societal sector; business, medical, civil or military. In more extreme cases, if human-machine communications become the norm, then human-human communication may in turn suffer as a result. Which could lead to problems down the line.
								</p>
								<br>
								<p><strong>How will this affect you?</strong><br>
								Natural language processing, and any constituent software or machines that use it, will likely influence the way in which society is influenced by digital technology. As natural language processing dabbles in the subject of communication from human to machine and machine to human, it is one of the factors that determine the functionality of some societal sectors(atleast the ones that utilize the technology).
								</p>
								<p>Natural language processing in its current form, allows for humans to communicate orders or provide queries to a machine or software. Depending on the design of either of these, the user may or may not require specialized training to properly pose said query or order. As an example of software that requires little to no specialized training to use, some mobile phones are able to receive voice commands from the user. This allows for the user to use the device without having to conform to the needs of a computational language. As an example of software that requires understanding and specialized training to use, CAD building and system design software is applicable. CAD software in its current stage, requires manual human input for every detail and subsequent understanding of the nuances involved for all of said details; the software is unable to design a house or system on command.
								</p>
								<p>The future of commercial or professional usage for those in a society, is such that we could see software(such as CAD) become more accessible and, in more extreme cases, have less need of individuals who know how to use a specific program/software/machine, as said device is so capable at explaining what it requires(due to natural language processing) and producing desired results, that it becomes unnecessary for society to produce or sustain such individuals

								<h2 class="major">Project Idea</h2>
								<h3>Overview</h3>
								<p>The product team PlanIT has been developing is a simple PC Power Supply (P/S) Tester that would allow even the most electrically illiterate people the capability to test their own power supplies at home safely. This reduces the risk to the average user who may have no formal training in using test equipment, such as a multimeter, safely and in a manner to reduce risk.
								</p>
								<p>The P/S Tester would be contained in a nonconductive case to with all circuitry contained inside and will be built to Australian and International Standards. The user can test their PC P/S but connecting the main outputs as specified by the P/S manufacturer to supply voltages to the standard ATX 24 pin sockets, utilising the P/S under tests' connection cables. The user will receive four green lights if the P/S tested is performing as required to power a motherboard.

								<h3>Function Description</h3>
								<p>This functional description pertains to the prototype, as the product changes and more is added to the final revision, the descriptions will be added to this section.
								</p>
								<p>This P/S Tester takes the four standard output voltages from a conventional PC P/S and runs each one through a test, where on a pass a green LED will light to confirm the power output from the power supply meets a tolerance as documented. All voltages mentioned below are DC voltages.
								</p>
								<p>The +3.3V line runs through three in series diodes before going through the LED, with its anode towards source, in parallel to a 1kΩ resistor to ground. This will ensure that the power from output of the P/S is at minimum +2.8V.
								</p>
								<p>The +5V line runs in series through, a diode then a 3.3V Zener diode. These two diodes have their cathodes joined with their anodes facing to the other connection points. The line then connects through the LED, with its anode towards source, in parallel to a 1kΩ resistor to ground. The minimum voltage output from the P/S to illuminate the LED is +4.8V
								</p>
								<p>The +12V line runs through two 5.1V Zener diodes in series with their cathodes towards the source. The line then connects through the LED, with its anode towards source, in parallel to a 1kΩ resistor to ground. The minimum voltage output from the P/S needs to meet a minimum of +10.9V to illuminate the LED.
								</p>
								<p>
								</p>The -12V line runs in series into two 5.1V Zener diodes with the anode towards the source. The line then continues through the LED, with its cathode towards source, in parallel to a 1kΩ resistor to ground. The P/S requires an output to reach a minimum of -10.9V before LED will illuminate.

								<h3>Tools and Software</h3>
								<p>Multisim is a program that allows for the testing and development of circuits in a simulated environment that helps with finding any problems early on in the concept stage before production has begun. There is a free online version that can be used though the purchased product is recommended for more complex circuits, or if requiring more accurate results. The purchased product allows for testing of components to failure points.
								</p>
								<p>Eagle is an electronic design automation software (EDA) that allows for the design of printed circuit boards (PCB) from nothing, or even using a schematic as a starting point. This program can also export the final board design with routing or etching maps to various libraries that can be utilised by manufacturers to produce PCB's as required by the end user.
								</p>
								<p>AutoCAD is a computer-aided design software that allows for drafting, designing, and documenting of 2D and 3D drawings. Various aspects of this software can be used for different tasks, such as using AutoCAD for designing the outer case for the final product, which can be exported as a file to be utilised on a 3D printer. Alternatively, included in the software bundle, is AutoCAD Electrical which would be used to document and track changes to product schematics. Both this product and Eagle are produced by Autodesk and as such integrate with each-other easily.
								</p>
								<p>Any temperature-controlled soldering iron, which is employed in the production of proof-of-concept and prototype products. All connections are to adhere to AS/NZS 3000:20084, J-STD-001G5, and IPC-A-610G5 standards, with component tolerances documented in the schematics where required.
								</p>
								<p>Variable Power Generators allow for controlled testing of prototype circuits to prevent damage to both the prototype and removes risk of destroying a PC P/S while still in the testing stage. Also required to test for the tolerances of the final product.
								</p>
								<p>Required to ensure components, voltages, and resistances meet required tolerances as documented. As such these products would require a calibration routine to be established to ensure consistency throughout lifetime of the P/S testers product life. All ground points to be tested to ground pin with maximum resistance of 0.2Ω.
								</p>
								<p>Insulation Tester – Required for testing the product, allowing the assurance of meeting Australian standards. Testing of any cable is to be conducted at minimum twice the voltage of the line as specified in the schematic. Minimum resistance of any insulation test is to be no less than 1MΩ.
								</p>

								<h3>Problems Arising and Improvements to Implement</h3>
								<p>First improvement to be implemented is changing out the connector to be an ATX 24 pin power supply socket. This socket is a standard motherboard connector and as such the power supplied to each pin is consistent regardless of power supply. If testing a modular P/S then the user is to ensure they are using cables as supplied with the power supply. This change is required as there is no standard pinout for cables connecting to the power supply. As well as limiting the tester to only being able to test modular power supplies, the tester would be restricted to only testing power supplies that have matching connectors with identical pinouts. This is very restrictive as most manufacturers have their own various pinouts for their products.
								</p>
								<p>A lamp test to give the user the reassurance that if the power being tested is correct then the LED will light up. To implement this the tester would require an onboard battery to be added as well as its own circuitry to be designed and implemented, including the follow-on testing to ensure this doesn't reduce the reliability of the final product.
								</p>
								<p>An OK-To-Test lamp as an indicator to the user that they have established an adequate path to ground to allow for testing of the power supply to be conducted. Before the incorporation of this aspect, research is needed to ensure that there is always a path to ground through a connected power supply despite the power switch being turned off. If added to the final product then steps would be added to the operating procedures that will be made available to users.
								</p>
								<p>Current voltage test is based off all powers generated going to individual rails before outputting. If same voltage levels are made to different rails then product would need to be expanded to incorporate a test for each rail, possibly requiring additional plugs to test each rail. This is at least relatively easy to implement as the design for each voltage test would already be completed and would just need to be duplicated for an improved product with the expanded capability.
								</p>
								<p>Include a fused circuit near the input to protect the P/S Tester from stray voltages from a bad power supply. These fuses would need to be accessible and easily changed from the outside of the case, even if covered in the same manner as the batteries for most commercial products.

								<h2 class="major">Group Reflection</h2>
								<h3>Michael</h3>
								<p>Had a lot of trouble at the start trying to establish any form of communication with the team. Once we had a discord channel though we started getting some talks started. It was a big stress relief to see after having to be away for a week due to work to come back and see that at least Martin, Tim, and Trent had been able to start effective communication and get our progress started. I was a little disappointed that we were still having no communications with Megha and Hetu, especially since they were the first two to originally join the group.
								</p>
								<p>The team that remained worked really well together and once we all had our individual tasks assigned, we showed great trust in each other to get the task done and were all able to produce products that our entire team is more than happy with. I was really happy with the work put in by everyone and glad to see the progress our team has been able to make in such a short time frame. Looking forward to seeing how we go with the next assignment now that we have started.
								</p>
								<h3>Timothy</h3>
								<p>I believe the things that went well would be that we were able to sort out who was doing which task and we could have trust in each other that we would be happy with the work. We also sent each section to each other which allowed everyone to read over it and make sure they were happy with it and we were open to others changing parts if they deemed it necessary.
								</p>
								<p>It would have been an easier task if we were able to sit down in a classroom together to allocate roles and talk about each topic more, but that is not an improvement that can be made at this challenging time. At first communication was a bit hard but I believe it came strong in the end.
								</p>
								<p>I was surprised that everyone was able to go on their own in a sense to complete different sections and still work things out even when it got a big tough. Also when two members of the group did not participate there was no hesitation for anyone to pick up the slack.
								</p>
								<p>One thing I learned about groups is that group work can be challenging but if you identify  each others strengths and work toward them, it will make the work suit everybody a lot more and overall you will get a better result as that is where each others knowledge thrives.
								</p>
								<h3>Trent</h3>
								<p>There is no doubt that team PlanIT worked incredibly hard to get the job done. Having two members fail to communicate with us, it was incredibly reassuring to see each of our team pick up the pieces to what remained without any hesitation.
								</p>
								<p>I believe everyones work ethic to be of immense value within our group. There was not one single moment of conflict or even disagreement. Our communication was outstanding, whenever you needed to get in contact with another member; within an hour they were there with a reply and a solution. Each member of our group resides in a different time-zone, but this did not stop us from mainting effective and productive communication. I am very proud of my teams ability to hold strong and approach tasks and each other with a great amount of respect.
								</p>
								<p>I got to know the group members that were active, and I learnt a few things about them. Martin is the Swedish powerhouse who can write and write and write some more. Tim is in the same boat as I; we both are studying three subjects, have beautiful dogs and both have a partner that does not like undivided attention (we had a laugh). Michael turned out to be a Logician, the same as I. Although he doesn’t believe in the tests we did, he did a very good job at explaining his counter-argument very logically, and analytically; which are the two main qualities of a Logician ahaha.
								</p>
								<p>Martin was the Swedish powerhouse because he’s currently in Sweden. He was able to research the entire IT Industry section alone. Michael was able to complete the project idea as he had all the tools and experience in doing so, he did a great job. And Tim, he was there when you needed him. He would launch himself at any task given and always put his hand up to help. I was in charge of our group repository, website and the IT interview – which I conducted with the owner of the company I am developing my app idea which was mentioned in Assessment 1.
								</p>
								<p>Overall I enjoyed my team and look forward to working with them in the future. We have discussed our approach for next assessment and I beleive we will be prepared and better off. We have built the trust of each other, and have proven our work ethic. We should be unstoppable now.
								</p>
								<h3>Martin</h3>
								<p>I believe that our group worked well together. We were able to converse about the assignment and relegate various tasks to each other if the need arose. We were able to complete major parts of the assignment, despite our late start.
								</p>
								<p>Improvements come in the form of time management on my part. I was unable to complete my assigned section within a desirable time frame. This could have been avoided if I had started the assignment at an earlier time, or if I was able to more effectively use what time I had.
								</p>
								<p>One surprising factor I noticed was the relief that came with being assigned only a part of an entire assignment. This particular assignment has many sections which have different requirements, some of which are of particular weakness to me, e.g. setting up a website or coming up with and executing a project idea. So I was very happy to know that others in the group did not have this particular weakness.
								</p>
								<p>I have learned about the advantage of groups. I have not experienced group work in a while. So it was very exhilarating to remember what it is like to be a part of a group that needs to work together.
